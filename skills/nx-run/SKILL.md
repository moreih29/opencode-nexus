description: Execution — user-directed agent composition.

## Role

Execution norm that Lead follows when the user invokes the `[run]` tag. Reads tasks.json, dynamically composes subagents based on the `owner` field, and drives the execute-verify-complete cycle.

## Constraints

- NEVER execute without a plan. If tasks.json is absent, invoke nx-auto-plan first to generate one, then return.
- Tasks are executed by their `owner`. Delegation to the matching subagent is the default — not Lead solo handling.
- NEVER stop while incomplete tasks remain. Continue the cycle until `nx_task_list` confirms all tasks are `completed`.
- NEVER work on main/master. Move to a branch appropriate to the task type before starting execution.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Preparation

- **Branch Guard**: if on main/master, create and switch to a branch matching the task type (prefix: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `research/`, etc. — Lead's judgment).
- **Load tasks.json**:
  - **Exists** → read the list with `nx_task_list` and check prior decisions with `nx_plan_status`.
  - **Absent** → auto-invoke `skill({ name: "nx-auto-plan" })` to generate tasks.json. Do NOT ask the user — `[run]` implies execution intent.

### Step 2: Execute

#### Task Registration

For each task, call `nx_task_add({ subject: "<label>" }) then nx_task_update({ taskId, status: "pending" })` to register progress tracking. Keep registrations to a maximum of 10. If tasks exceed 10, group related tasks by a natural grouping unit such as `plan_issue` or target file, so that registered entries stay within 10.

#### Task Dispatch

- Execute tasks according to the `owner` field.
  - `owner: "lead"` → Lead handles directly.
  - Others → spawn the subagent matching the owner role.
- Pass the task's `context`, `approach`, and `acceptance` as the prompt to each subagent.
- **Resume decision**: for each task, query `nx_task_resume` for resume routing information and decide whether to spawn fresh or resume according to the Resume Dispatch Rule below.
- **Parallel execution**: tasks with no deps can be spawned in parallel. Serialize tasks that share overlapping target files.

#### State Transitions

- On task start, update to `in_progress` via `nx_task_update`; on completion, update to `completed`.
- When transitioning a task to `completed`, include `result: {outcome, summary, artifacts?}` in the same `nx_task_update` call. `recorded_at` is server-stamped. Note that `status` records the workflow stage and `result.outcome` records the end verdict — they are orthogonal.
- When a subagent is freshly spawned, include `owner={role, agent_id: <id from spawn>, resume_tier: <ephemeral|bounded|persistent>}` in the same `nx_task_update` call so that a future `nx_task_resume` can return this id.
- At the same moment, update progress tracking with `nx_task_add({ subject: "<label>" }) then nx_task_update({ taskId, status: "in_progress" })` / `nx_task_add({ subject: "<label>" }) then nx_task_update({ taskId, status: "completed" })`. Reuse the exact label set at initial registration.

### Resume Dispatch Rule

Lead acts based on the `resume_tier` and `agent_id` values returned by `nx_task_resume`.

- `ephemeral` → spawn fresh.
- `bounded` → resume if the same owner has prior work on overlapping target files and no other agent has edited in between. The resume prompt MUST include an instruction to "re-read target files before making any modifications."
- `persistent` → resume if the same agent participated in a prior task in this run. Cross-task reuse allowed.

When resume is chosen, invoke the `task({ task_id: "<id>", prompt: "<resume prompt>" })` tool with the `agent_id` returned by `nx_task_resume`. Always provide a fresh resume prompt — some harnesses (OpenCode) do not expose a path to push additional input into a running session and support resume only by injecting a new prompt into an idle session.

If `nx_task_resume` returns `agent_id: null`, or the harness can no longer locate that id, fall back to fresh spawn silently — do NOT throw an error.

### Escalation Chain

After receiving the Check result, Lead routes. Two inputs are read: Verdict and Flagged issues classification.

#### Verdict Inputs

| Verifier | PASS | Routing entry |
|---|---|---|
| Tester | PASS | FAIL |
| Reviewer | APPROVED | REVISION_REQUIRED · BLOCKED |

#### Routing Rules

Lead decides the next action based on the Flagged issues classification in the Check report.

| Flagged issues classification | Next action |
|---|---|
| Design flaw · architectural change required | Spawn the domain-matched HOW → consult → re-delegate to Do |
| Scope conflict · user decision required · ambiguous judgment | Report to user · request direction |
| Environment problem · unverifiable (UNVERIFIABLE included) | Fix environment / retry. If unresolvable, report to user |
| Other (simple failure) | Re-delegate to the same Do (count +1) |

Failures with a clear classification branch immediately at count zero. Only simple failures accumulate the count.

#### Simple-Failure Cumulative Count

```
Do → Check(fail) → Do → Check(fail) → HOW → Do → Check(fail) → Lead → user
```

- **1st** → re-delegate to the same Do (attach failure feedback to the prompt)
- **2nd consecutive** → spawn the domain-matched HOW → consult on approach → re-delegate to Do
- **Still failing after HOW consultation** → report to the user with diagnostic details and request direction

#### Mid-Do Notification Handling

Do/Check agents may notify directly mid-task or in their completion reports per their own body definitions. When Lead receives such a notification, it applies the routing rules above immediately — independent of the chain count.

### Step 3: Verify

Lead delegates verification to the Check subagent using each task's `acceptance` field. Detailed judgment is the subagent's autonomous domain.

- **Tester** — code verification (engineer deliverables).
- **Reviewer** — document verification (writer deliverables).

Verification failures follow the Escalation Chain above.

### Step 4: End-of-Cycle Review

Once all tasks reach `completed` state, Lead reviews the cycle and decides whether to close.

**Review scope**

- Alignment between the original user request and the result — any missing area?
- Cross-task deliverable integration — do the outputs operate without contradiction?
- Any follow-ups implied but not explicitly stated within the request?

**HOW consultation**

Spawning the domain-matched HOW for cross-task review is the default — Architect for code, Designer for UX, Postdoc for research methodology. **If you skip the consultation, state the reason in the cycle-end report** — justified-skip examples: existing decisions or retrospectives already cover the cycle outcome / a single-task cycle with no cross-task review target / change radius is contained within one module with low irreversibility.

When recording cycle-end synthesis or task failure notes via `nx_plan_analysis_add`, use `role='retrospective'` for end-of-cycle synthesis and `role='failure-note'` for per-task failure annotations. These two values are reserved as classification anchors for `nx_history_search`; arbitrary role values are also permitted.

**Actions by decision**

| Decision | Action |
|---|---|
| No additional work | Proceed to Step 5 Complete |
| Missing coverage found | Register a new task with `nx_task_add` → return to Step 2 Execute |
| Existing task needs rework | Reopen with `nx_task_update` → return to Step 2 Execute |

**Iteration cap**

The review runs at most **twice per cycle** (initial + one re-review). After follow-up work brings all tasks back to `completed`, the second review runs. If gaps remain at the second review, do NOT auto-register more work — report to the user and let them decide whether to extend the cycle. Extending the cycle is the user's decision domain.

**Scope discipline**

Catch missing coverage only within the original user request. Quality-improvement ideas outside the request are deferred to a new plan cycle — preventing scope creep within the current cycle.

### Step 5: Complete

Execute in order.

1. **`nx_task_close`**: archives plan+tasks to `.nexus/history.json`. `plan.json` and `tasks.json` are removed.
2. **git commit**: bundle source changes, build artifacts (`bridge/`, `scripts/`), `.nexus/history.json`, and any modified `.nexus/memory/` or `.nexus/context/` into a single commit to maintain 1:1 cycle-commit mapping. Use explicit paths instead of `git add -A`.
3. **Report**: summarize to the user using the items below. Merge/push is the user's decision and outside this skill's scope.
   - **Changes**: file paths and summary
   - **Key decisions**: scope, approach, trade-offs
   - **Next steps**: follow-up actions
   - **Open questions**: when applicable
   - **Risks / uncertainties**: express in the form "X may fail under Y condition", when applicable

## Reference Framework

| Phase | Owner | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Preparation | Lead | Branch Guard, read tasks.json via `nx_task_list` / invoke nx-auto-plan if absent |
| 2. Execute | Do subagents | Spawn per owner, resume decision via `nx_task_resume`, state transitions via `nx_task_update` |
| 3. Verify | Check subagents | Tester (code) / Reviewer (document) verification against `acceptance` criteria |
| 4. End-of-Cycle Review | Lead (HOW if needed) | Cycle-level review, register additional work or close |
| 5. Complete | Lead | `nx_task_close`, git commit, report |

## Structured Delegation

When Lead delegates a task to a subagent, structure the prompt in this format:

```
TASK: {specific deliverable}

CONTEXT:
- Current state: {relevant code/doc locations}
- Dependencies: {results from prior tasks}
- Prior decisions: {relevant decisions}
- Target files: {file path list}

CONSTRAINTS:
- {constraint 1}
- {constraint 2}

ACCEPTANCE:
- {completion criterion 1}
- {completion criterion 2}
```

---

## State Management

`.nexus/state/tasks.json` is created by nx-plan variants (plan/auto-plan) via `nx_task_add`, and state transitions during the nx-run cycle are reflected via `nx_task_update`. Querying is handled by `nx_task_list`, and resume decisions by `nx_task_resume`. On cycle end, call `nx_task_close` to archive plan+tasks to `.nexus/history.json`.
