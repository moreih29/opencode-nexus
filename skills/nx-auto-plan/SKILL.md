name: nx-auto-plan
description: Autonomous planning skill — Lead decomposes, analyzes, and decides
  issues without user confirmation, producing an execution plan. Keeps nx-plan's
  research and analysis depth while skipping user dialogue.
---
## Role

For each issue, collaborate with HOW subagents (architect/designer/postdoc/strategist), researcher, and explore to gather multi-angle analysis, then synthesize the results so Lead records the decision directly without waiting for a user response.

The flow is as follows:

1. For each issue, dynamically spawn the HOW subagent(s) matching its domain to receive independent analysis.
2. Use explore when codebase orientation is needed and researcher when external investigation is needed.
3. Lead synthesizes the gathered analysis, compares candidate options, and selects the most reasonable one.
4. Decisions are recorded by Lead directly via `nx_plan_decide` without user confirmation; once all issues are decided, brief the user in a single pass.

This skill does not execute. Execution is handled separately by the `[run]` flow. It is also the path `[run]` invokes internally when tasks.json is absent.

## Core Rules — Absolute Rules

The four rules below are the identity of this skill. **Violating even one departs from auto-plan's intended form.**

1. **Collaborate with HOW/researcher/explore to analyze each issue.** Spawning the HOW subagent matching the issue's domain is the default; bring in explore for code understanding and researcher for external investigation. Do NOT settle issues by Lead's solo reasoning — to skip collaboration, state the reason (e.g., a trivial issue Lead can decide alone, or identical analysis already present in `.nexus/memory`/`context`/`history`) explicitly in the analysis text.
2. **Lead decides autonomously.** NEVER ask the user for option choices, delegate decision authority, or request acceptance. All decisions are recorded directly by Lead via `nx_plan_decide` after internal deliberation grounded in the collaboration results.
3. **NEVER produce output that asks the user to decide.** Do not emit comparison tables, A/B/C option enumerations, or questions like "which option would you prefer?" to the user. However, **the comparison work and per-issue analysis records themselves are normal activity** — candidate comparison happens in Lead's internal deliberation, and its core findings and dismissal rationale are written into the decision text in prose form. They are not externalized, but that does not mean they must not be produced.
4. **NEVER stop for user confirmation.** Proceed from issue analysis → `nx_plan_decide` → next issue without seeking confirmation or sending intermediate approval requests immediately after individual decisions. The user-facing report happens only once at the Step 7 briefing after all issues are decided. **Waiting for HOW subagent results is not stopping** — when the issue's depth requires it, spawn HOW and wait for the results before deciding. What must not stop is "user confirmation," not "analytical depth."

## Supplementary Rules

- NEVER execute — this skill's purpose is planning; execution is handled by `[run]`.
- Research and analysis depth MUST match nx-plan. HOW subagent spawning, researcher/explore investigations, and the existing-knowledge-first principle all apply.
- Each decision MUST record **both the selected rationale and the rejected alternatives.** Comparison tables are not output, but deliberation record within the decision text is mandatory.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Intent Discovery

Determine issue scope and complexity from the request itself. **Do NOT conduct additional user interviews or clarification questions.** When information is insufficient, supplement with research; if ambiguity remains unresolved, note it in the decision text's "assumptions" field and proceed in the direction Lead judges most reasonable.

| Level | Signal | Exploration Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Specific | File path, function name, error message, or concrete target named | Focus on the relevant file or module |
| Direction-setting | Open-ended question, "it would be nice if ~", choice needed among approaches | Related area + external case research |
| Abstract | Goal itself unclear, fundamental direction needed | Full codebase + external research + comparable project comparison |

- Specific request → derive issues immediately.
- Direction-setting → Lead selects the most reasonable direction based on research findings.
- Abstract → broaden research scope and have Lead infer the root goal.

#### HOW Subagent Selection

- Lead autonomously selects HOW subagents matching the issue scope.
- If the user explicitly named HOW agents, use them as-is and add missing axes when visible.
- Additional HOW subagents can be spawned at any point during analysis.

### Step 2: Research

Understand code, core knowledge, and prior decisions before forming the planning agenda.

#### Existing Knowledge First

- Read `.nexus/memory/` and `.nexus/context/` first.
- Use `nx_history_search` to check whether prior decisions exist on similar topics.
- If the needed information is already available, use it directly and skip or narrow subagent spawning.

#### Approach Selection

| Situation | Approach |
|---|---|
| Codebase orientation needed | `task({ subagent_type: "explore", prompt: "<file/code search task>", description: "explore" })` for codebase exploration |
| External research needed | `task({ subagent_type: "researcher", prompt: "<research question>", description: "researcher" })` for web search |
| Both needed | Spawn `task({ subagent_type: "explore", prompt: "<file/code search task>", description: "explore" })` and `task({ subagent_type: "researcher", prompt: "<research question>", description: "researcher" })` in parallel |

- Researcher subagents return findings to Lead and do not participate in the auto-plan session itself.

### Step 3: Session Start

Once research is complete, open the planning session with `nx_plan_start`. Any existing `plan.json` is automatically archived. Unlike nx-plan, the issue list is NOT presented to the user beforehand — proceed directly to Step 4.

### Step 4: Issue-by-Issue Analysis

Process issues one at a time. For each issue:

1. Lead summarizes the current state and the problem.
2. If needed, spawn HOW subagents for independent analysis.
   - If reusing context from a prior HOW session for the same role is advantageous, check resume routing information with `nx_plan_resume` first.
   - If resumable, invoke `task({ task_id: "<id>", prompt: "<resume prompt>" })` with the `agent_id` returned by `nx_plan_resume`; otherwise, spawn fresh.
3. When HOW results return, record them on the issue with `nx_plan_analysis_add(issue_id, role, agent_id=<id from spawn>, summary)`. The `agent_id` is the value `nx_plan_resume` will return on a future resume request for the same role, so always pass the agent id obtained from the spawn tool response. Do not substitute a human-readable assigned name; names are only for messaging a currently running subagent and are not a safe resume identifier for a completed session.
4. **Lead internal deliberation**: enumerate candidate options, compare pros/cons and trade-offs, and select the most reasonable one. **The outputs of this process (comparison tables, option lists, recommendation questions) MUST NOT be shown to the user.** All comparison happens entirely inside Lead; the conclusion and dismissal rationale are recorded in prose form in the Step 5 decision text.
5. **⚡ Never stop.** Do not wait for user response; proceed immediately to Step 5 to record the decision. Do NOT send intermediate confirmation messages.

#### HOW Domain Mapping

| Domain Keywords | Recommended HOW |
|---|---|
| UI, UX, design, interface, user experience, layout | Designer |
| Architecture, system design, performance, structural change, API, schema | Architect |
| Business, market, strategy, positioning, competition, revenue | Strategist |
| Research methodology, evidence evaluation, literature, experiment design | Postdoc |

- If an issue matches a domain above, spawning the corresponding HOW is the default.
- If the issue crosses multiple domains, spawn multiple HOWs together.
- To skip spawning, state the reason explicitly in the analysis text.

### Step 5: Record Decision

Use `nx_plan_decide` to mark the issue as decided. **Lead records directly without requesting user confirmation.** The decision text MUST include:

- The selected approach and its rationale
- The rejected alternatives and their dismissal reasons
- (When applicable) assumptions made due to insufficient information

`nx_plan_decide` records only the final decision text and decision state — it does **not** append to `analysis`. If HOW subagents participated, their analysis and resume-routing records must already have been written via `nx_plan_analysis_add` in Step 4, and Step 7 should reference those records directly.

If the decision creates follow-up questions or derived issues, add them with `nx_plan_update` and move to Step 6. Again, do NOT ask the user for confirmation.

### Step 6: Dynamic Agenda Management

- If derived issues emerge, add them via `nx_plan_update` and return to Step 4. **Do NOT ask the user for permission to add.**
- If unresolved issues remain, move on to the next issue. Do NOT issue intermediate status reports.
- Once all issues are decided, Lead checks for gaps against the original request. This check is performed internally only.
- If gaps exist, register new issues with `nx_plan_update` and return to Step 4.

### Step 7: Briefing and Plan Document Generation

Once all issues are decided, brief the user in a single pass:

```
[auto-plan complete] N issues, N decisions
- #1: {selected} ({rejected alternative} — reason)
- #2: ...
```

Immediately after briefing, decompose the decisions from `plan.json` into actionable tasks and populate `tasks.json` via `nx_task_add`. From this point, task tools — not plan tools — take over.

Fill in the following fields for each task:

- `approach` — implementation strategy derived from the decision rationale
- `acceptance` — definition of done, verifiable criteria
- `risk` — risks surfaced during analysis
- `deps` — execution-order dependencies
- `owner` — assigned according to the criteria below

For issues where HOW subagents participated, reference the analysis recorded in Step 4, or re-spawn the same HOW to request domain-appropriate decomposition.

#### Owner Assignment Criteria

| Work Type | owner | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Single file, small change | `lead` | Subagent overhead exceeds task effort |
| Code implementation | `engineer` | Source code creation or modification |
| Documentation/content | `writer` | `.md`, README, docs, non-code content |
| External research | `researcher` | External information gathering required |
| Design analysis / review | HOW role | Technical judgment is the core work |
| Sequential edits to the same file | `lead` | High risk of parallel edit conflicts |

#### Verification Auto-Pairing

- If an `engineer` task has a runtime-behavior criterion in its acceptance, pair a `tester` task.
- If a `writer` task has a verifiable deliverable criterion in its acceptance, pair a `reviewer` task.
- Researcher tasks are not auto-paired by default.

Once tasks are generated, instruct the user to execute with `[run]`. If this skill was invoked internally by `[run]`, hand off to the run flow directly without the instruction.
